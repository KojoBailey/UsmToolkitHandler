# UsmToolkit Handler
This tool acts as a handler for [UsmToolkit](https://github.com/MightyZanark/UsmToolkit) (I link the one by MightyZanark because it's the one that actually works, and well), making the process of converting USM files faster and easier for users, especially those who are not comfortable with terminal-based tools.

## Guide
`Handler.exe` goes into the same directory as `UsmToolkit.exe`. The EXE's location is important.

Then, all you have to do is **drag-and-drop** the USM you want to convert **onto the EXE**, and it will **automatically** run the conversion command for UsmToolkit. If you're on default settings, this will create an MP4 video in the same directory, as well as an M2V and ADX file (which is what FFmpeg converts from).

And that's it! If there's anything else you'd like to see from this, let me know somehow (you can message me on Discord @`kojobailey`).
